I've been thinking about attention lately—how it flows, where it lands, and how it's not just divided but increasingly *automated*. It seems like every entrepreneur I connect with these days mentions their ADHD, and it's no wonder! We've spent the last decade training our attention to be always on the lookout for and open to distractions. Our devices decide what deserves our focus, algorithms determine what fills our vision, and notifications choreograph the rhythm of our days.

This isn't a new insight—countless books, podcasts, and wellness influencers have been sounding alarms about our attention crisis for years now.[^1] What's emerging for me, though, is a nuanced challenge that's rarely addressed: the dangerous intersection where *distractibility* collides with our increasing dependence on *automation*.

## PRACTICE

This week, I invite us to practice building our muscle of *noticing* through a simple somatic exercise that helps regulate our nervous systems while training our attention. This practice takes just a minute, but can be transformative when stacked into our existing daily routines.

1. Choose an everyday moment when you typically reach for your phone (waiting for coffee, standing in line, getting out of bed).
2. First, **ground yourself** physically: Feel your feet. Notice the weight of your body against whatever is supporting you. Take one full breath, feeling your ribcage expand and contract.
3. **Stand still** in your attention. Look up and around.
4. Find something—anything—within your field of vision. A plant, a crack in the sidewalk, a stranger's shoes, the way light falls across your hand.
5. For 30-60 seconds, give this object or phenomenon your complete, undivided attention. Study it as if you were the first person ever to really see it. Notice its uniqueness, its particularity.
6. Ask silently: *What might I see if I treat this as a powerful stranger? What is lost on me that might be revealed if I stand still?*

**What might you discover when you stand still enough to be found?**

I'd love to hear what emerges for you through this practice. Share in the comments or reply to this email.
