# Clearing for the New Moon

*continuing practice around release as we prepare for the darkest of nights*

This morning, I woke to bathe in the soft glow of the Chesire’s grin, opposite Orien’s protection. On these waning crescent nights, I’m reminded of the stillness in the darkness—a quietness that invites introspection and allows our inner voice to be heard. And so I sat down to clear—starting with my anxious mind—and this is the practice that emerged in anticipation of the New Moon.

I encourage you *(as I encouraged myself)* to sit with it long enough to clear, but not so long that you're cleaning. Cleaning up and taking action can follow, but often we feel a pang of desire to take immediate action to avoid being with the emotions and energies that need to flow in order to clear. 

**The Practice:** set a timer for ±15 minutes and if you’re not yet complete when the time rings, simply pause and move onto the last step. You can repeat the practice as needed and to deepen.

What’s been keeping me up, waking me up, or what have I been putting off? *This is intended to be rapid-fire, off-the-cuff, like stepping into a room and scanning for clutter—we’re not here for a deep clean. Take a beat to notice what’s happening in your body.*

*Take a moment to imagine these piles being cleared.* Clearing these piles will support me to live more freely inside of the experience I want to be having, and that is: *__notice how it feels to have these stacks cleared__.*

*Take a moment to assess:*

(a) What themes emerge? What can I let go of and what can I group together?

*Cross off anything that doesn’t need your continued attention at this time. Notice any resistance and excitement arising.*

*If you’re itching to get into action, create “action blocks” for anything you can tackle in < 30 minutes—and resist the urge to dive until until you complete this process.*

(b) What do these reveal about what I truly care about? If fear arises, what are the underlying desires or cares? 

*Take a moment to really sit with yourself inside of these cares and desires. What do you notice as you reconnect with what you care about?*

Take a moment to feel for your seat/feet, feel gravity, and relax into your breath. *After a few beats, repeat after me:* **I release what’s not mine, embrace what is. My energy is clear and free. **

*FWIW: My favorite digital flow is using OmmWriter to block distractions and logging in DayOne (where I can also record voice entries). And I always have several notebooks on hand that I use as bullet journals.*
