# Strengthening Acceptance for Global Change: Getting Started
*Reflection Questions to begin a strength practice for self-acceptance and acceptance of others in pursuit of lasting, vital change.*


With an election year well underway, we’re bombarded with more than harsh critiques of candidates and policies. We’re bombarded with shame, condemnation, and a viscious struggle to gain “Power-Over[^1]” a nation and world through wronging others. In these struggles, we’re at risk of spending more energy on _wronging_ and what we _don’t_ want vs what we _do._ This endless tug-of-war (and wars) are draining our vitality.

Energy follows attention, so we need to **shift our attention**.

_In future bites, we’ll work through how we bring this shift into our actions. Until then, my ask is that you consider this practice alongside whatever you’re already doing to enact change._

Change is a paradox[^2]: **to create change, we must first accept what is.** Without acceptance, our energy is tied up in protecting ourselves—strengthening whatever position or habit we want to change. On the contrast, in a space of radical acceptance, our energy is freed and we have access to choice—for transformative and lasting change.

What’s one state of mind you wish you could change, in yourself or another?  What stands in the way of being able to accept that state of mind?

If you’re human, you may run into common barriers to acceptance such as 

*   requiring Approval: I simply cannot approve of X,Y,Z, therefore I cannot accept it.
    

*   Judgment: I can’t accept that which is (morally/ethically/universally) wrong!
    

*   Attachment to an outcome: It was supposed to be, should have gone, some other way—this is unacceptable.
    

*   Blame—requiring Accountability to be taken/given first, making Acceptance conditional
    

As you get familiar with what’s in the way, take a moment to feel into your body. Where can you feel that resistance?

These questions are offered as a first step to bring awareness into our relationship with Acceptance. There’s no right or wrong way to be in this step or with what may come up. In this, we’re beginning a practice of

*   **acknowledging** what is present for us as we examine our _relationship_ to Acceptance, _without_ judgment or explanation
    
*   **accepting** what comes up within this practice—_accepting_ our relationship to Acceptance without trying to change it.
    

I’d love to hear what comes up for you as you practice.

**PRACTICE:** Set a timer for 5 minutes and write out your answers to the reflection questions.

**REFLECT:** What’s one state of mind you wish you could change, in yourself or another?  What stands in the way of being able to accept that state of mind? Where can you feel that resistance in your body?

[^1]: Coined by Mary Parker Follett, an early 20th century social worker who became a leading management guru, **Power-Over** is _coercion_ and **Power-With** is _coactive_. She saw collective impact, solving shared problems toward a common goal, as a deeply relational activity. You can begin learning more about her in this lovely [summary](https://www.michelezanini.com/mary-parker-follett-the-first-prophet-of-management/).

[^2]: The “[paradoxical theory of change](https://www.gestalt.org/arnie.htm)” was coined by Gestalt therapist Dr Arnold Beisser in 1970. It sums an ancient wisdom that we' can’t truly change until we accept who we already are.
