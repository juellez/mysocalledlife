The name comes from a concept found across myriad cultures and spiritual traditions, roughly translated from Sanskrit as “**Unstruck Sound**.” It refers to the primordial sound that exists within **all aspects of creation and life**—an underlying vibration/frequency that gives rise to **(a)** everything in existence and **(b)** a belief that you can live a more fulfilling life when you have the **space and support** to connect with (and feel your connection to) this **lifeforce and inner wisdom.** In our fast-paced world, it can feel daunting, if not impossible, to create space for ourselves, which is why I’m adamant about creating tiny pockets we can sprinkle into our everyday.
