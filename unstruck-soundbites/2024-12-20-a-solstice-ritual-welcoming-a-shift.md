# A Solstice Ritual: Welcoming a Shift and Reflection

*With a Bonus Bite-Sized Practice you can take at your desk or in the hustle of the holidays*

With the winter solstice upon us, I wanted to share a ritual received from my [friend Mariya](https://lovecoachmariya.com/) that weaves together the magic of the winter holidays and New Year’s Eve into a practice for the solstice eve (tonight). She calls it **Solifer Nox**: sun-bringing night.

For a time when you have a couple of hours to dedicate to wrapping up your year, I highly recommend my friend [Alex’s annual reflection questions](https://alexkroman.substack.com/p/the-december-year-end-review).

And for those who simply need a bite-sized practice to create space amidst the hustle of working to wrap up the year on the job and inside of social engagements, I’m sharing a **Spacious Belonging** grounding.

For everyone: a prayer for the light returning to our days—may you receive the gifts inside the light and feel your footing return.

Thank you for all of your incredible support and dedication to prioritizing space and healing for yourself, _especially_ amidst the bustle of every-day life. It’s an honor to share space and be a part of this wondrous universe of life with you.

> **Spacious Belonging Practice: 1+ minutes**
> 
> I had planned on sharing this as a short video until I realized my audio didn’t work. So here’s a written guide through a seated practice, though you’re welcome to do it standing.
> 
> 1.  Scoot back an inch or two from your desk and take a deep breath, noticing what it feels like to be giving yourself some physical space.
>     
> 2.  With another breath, relax your shoulders and let your arms rest. Notice what it’s like to gently take up more space as you allow yourself to relax.
>     
> 3.  On your next exhale, let yourself sink into your chair, feeling for your seat and feet on the ground. Notice what it feels like to melt into gravity, being of this earth and on this earth.
>     
> 4.  Bring your focus to feeling into the spaciousness you can access in this moment, no matter how brief it may be in linear time. Let yourself relax into belonging here. Any thoughts and judgements that arise are welcome—there’s enough space for all of you and all of them to co-exist here without you needing to take them on or push them away.
>

> This is a practice you can move in and out of several times a day, whenever you need a moment to yourself—in service of cultivating space and belonging outside of time.
