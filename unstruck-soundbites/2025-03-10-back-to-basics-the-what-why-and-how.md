# Back to Basics: The What, Why, and How of Somatics

*Re-introducing somatics, why it matters, and how to build a practice that fits into your daily life.*

Hello loves. It’s been a couple of weeks since I posted, so I’m revisiting the basics—for myself and as a foundation for everyone joining me in these practices that create more space in our increasingly hectic lives.

At the root of any practice is repetition. Yet, posting the same content week after week feels … repetitive. So I challenged myself to honor what I need and to trust it’ll serve others. In this video, I revisit the essence of somatics: what it is, why I practice, and how you can use the fundamentals to get the most out of the practices I share—so you can make them your own.

Whether you’re new to somatics or looking to deepen your understanding, this is our foundation for living a more embodied, resilient, rewarding, and fulfilling life with freedom and ease. Let’s dive in!
