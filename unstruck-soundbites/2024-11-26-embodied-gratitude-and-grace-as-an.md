# Embodied Gratitude and Grace as an Antidote to Toxic Positivity

*a twist on traditional grace: an embodied blessing for a genuine experience*

As the end-of-year holiday season kicks off this week in the U.S. with Thanksgiving, we're reminded of the rising pressure to share what we're grateful for. And for some, this can trigger a phenomenon known as "**toxic positivity**."

While positivity isn't inherently toxic—the ability to create empowering meaning and silver linings in negative experiences is an admirable one and has been proven to bolster resilience and well-being—when this skill transforms into an expectation or demand that we must _always_ find the bright side, it can invalidate genuine suffering and block us from healing. This pressure to display only "positive" emotions while suppressing the "negative" ones invalidates our human experience, leading to trauma, isolation, and unhealthy coping mechanisms.

During the holidays, this dynamic looms larger. Our experience of life defies simple categorization, yet we're often forced into either/or distinctions. Having to vocalize gratitude and maintain positivity becomes crushing when we aren't allowed the space to acknowledge our heartbreak or struggle.

The flip side of this coin is what we might call "toxic mourning"—not allowing ourselves moments of joy or gratitude during difficult times, as if happiness diminishes our grief or the importance of our struggles.

So where can you give yourself the space, and honor space for others, to be with a wider experience that may extend beyond what we're grateful for? Even as we gather, many grapple with Thanksgiving's complex history and harmful roots in the US. The point isn't to ignore these truths or force gratitude—even silver-lining pros need time to alchemize hurt into lessons.

If you struggle with gratitude in times of strife—or if you struggle with allowing others their full experience—know that there's a gentler way forward. While meaning well by pushing positivity, we can cause harm if we don't create space to honor what's real.

The key lies in understanding that moods, including gratitude, can be practiced deliberately, much like we might practice an instrument or a sport. When we practice gratitude with intention and embodiment, we're **not forcing** positivity or **denying** our struggles—instead, we're developing our ability to access this state of being with greater ease and authenticity. Through repetitive practice, gratitude transforms from an _obligation_ into a _generative_ lens through which we can perceive life, expanding our resilience and opening us to a broader range of experiences we can appreciate, even amidst difficulty.

For a practice you can do on your own, see my post on '[Gratitude and Grief](https://unstrucksoundbites.substack.com/p/honoring-the-hearts-landscape-self)' (unlocked and free for all). For your holiday gathering, I offer this 'extended grace'—a practice that honors your full experience while cultivating authentic gratitude.

This is my new **Thanksgiving Grace**—and I invite you to make it your own.

> “As we gather together, I’d like to invite everyone to join me for an extended grace—a moment to pause and fully take in this experience of being together.”
> 
> Breathe. Deeply. Others will follow suit. For folx able to stand, it’s a great opportunity to invite to standing—though it can also be done while sitting.
> 
> “Let’s take a few, deep breaths together—in through the nose, extra delightful with all this food—and feel for our feet on the ground / our seats on the chairs. Notice what it’s like to be held by gravity, to be _of_ this earth. Now, imagine a string pulling up through our spine and out the top of our heads into the heavens. Notice what it feels like to be tethered to and be _of_ sky as we share in this communal life force we all breathe. Notice what it feels like to be connected to both heaven and earth / ground and sky at the same time.”
> 
> Continue breathing and feel into the collective. Did folx have to travel? Did your family/group experience hardships this year? Acknowledge what arises. You don’t have to get into the details to honor what’s alive for everyone at your table.
> 
> “However we’re showing up in this moment is perfect. If you notice any tensions, that’s OK. We get to be here, with each other, exactly as we are.”
> 
> If you feel called to add in a blessing, this is a great space—and then continue.
> 
> “Let’s extend our arms to the ground. Feel the aliveness that arises in your legs, your heart—and let that energy extend through your core, down your arms, into the earth. Feel for gratitude that swells up, for what supports us.”
> 
> Share what generates for you and invite others to share as they feel it or go around in a circle. This isn’t what we _should_ feel grateful for, but what genuinely rises up in our body. Commonly, this is where we’ll feel gratitude for the food, animals, plants, organisms, etc—whatever arises (or doesn’t) is perfect.
> 
> “Now, we’ll extend to the sky. Once again feeling for the aliveness that arises in your legs, your heart, through your arms—and letting that extend up into the heavens/sky.”
> 
> Repeat the sharing—popcorn style or in a circle.
> 
> “Now, we’ll extend out to each other—and those who we love but aren’t with us here today.”
> 
> You may (or may not) choose to hold hands. Share.
> 
> “Lastly, extend to yourself—left hand on heart, right on belly—in a practice of receiving. What are you grateful to yourself for?

Yummy! I'd love to hear how your version of this unfolds.
