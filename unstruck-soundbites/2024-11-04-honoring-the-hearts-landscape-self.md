Even amidst feelings of disconnection and discord within our communities[^1], we can cultivate inner peace and foster a sense of unity. As I seek to prioritize people over politics, I felt my way to this practice—guiding us to ground, connecting to the collective with gratitude while acknowledging grief, for the sake of fostering resilience, inner peace, and compassion.

May this help to expand your capacity to sit with the uncomfortable and to fuel *conscious* action for the sake of aligning with what you value and liberates us all.

**PRACTICE:** Find a quiet space where you can be undisturbed for ±10 minutes. I recommend a timer to help you move through each without risk of getting stuck and without having to split focus on time as you practice. (Want to practice in community?

1.  **Center and Ground (2 min):** Find a comfortable seated or standing position and bring your attention to your breath. Notice your natural rhythm around your in/exhale. Feel gravity holding you, noticing where you make contact with the earth (or chair/floor). Feel for your dignity in your length, as you both root into the ground and extend into sky. Reach your arms out wide and notice as your energy extends beyond your skin, to warm the space around you—feeling into your interconnectedness of being both an individual and part of a collective.
    
2.  **Extend into Gratitude (2-3 min):** Now, extend your arms down to the ground, feeling for what gratitude wants to well-up. Extend to the sky, feeling again for gratitude raining down. Extend out, feeling for relational gratitude. Wrap yourself in a hug, feeling for your heart’s gratitude. Savor this and notice how gratitude feels in your body—there is no right or wrong way to feel gratitude.
    
3.  **Acknowledge Grief (2-3 min):** As you remain grounded and anchored in gratitude, gently shift your attention to any grief, disappointment, or sadness you may be holding regarding division or disharmony within your community and the world. Try doing this with your eyes open, to help anchor you in the present moment, since grief can often take us out of time into a body memory. Perhaps it's a longing for connection, a sense of not belonging, not feeling safe, or concern for the well-being of others. Meet these feelings with compassion and curiosity: where do you feel them in your body?—a tightness in your throat, a heaviness in your shoulders, a sinking feeling in your stomach? Notice any sensations or emotions that arise, allowing them to be present without judgment.
    
4.  **Co-Existing (1-2 min):** Imagine your heart as a vast, open sky. In this sky, both gratitude and grief can coexist, like clouds of different shapes and sizes. Allow them to be present without needing to change or fix them. Notice how these feelings may shift or transform as you hold space for them.
    
5.  **Closing (1 min):** Gently bring your awareness back to your breath and open your eyes if they fell close. Let the light and room come back to you, taking a couple of deeper breaths, feeling once again for the ground beneath you.
    

**REFLECT:** How did it feel to hold space for both gratitude and grief simultaneously? Did you notice any resistance or judgment arising? What insights did this practice offer you about fostering unity and connection?

Amidst external chaos, our hearts remain a sanctuary of wisdom and resilience. If you could use community to practice with, join me and other lovely souls at [Kaleidoscope](https://kaleidoscopes.group/community). We’ve begun rounding up a list of various places we can practice together—and would love to keep it growing.

Sending you much love and compassion this week—and kudos for showing up for yourself. xo.j.

[^1]: Regardless of who wins the elections and what measures pass this week in the United States, millions of people will feel devastated, disappointed, scared, and disregarded—and even those who may find themselves happy for a win will also hold heart-break around their candidate/measure being far from perfect. Countless voters, for example, have publicly expressed dissent around their candidate’s support for war, genocide, and other human rights violations. We do not live in a binary world—even if the bulk of what we scroll through or is blasted at us via the media paints it otherwise.
