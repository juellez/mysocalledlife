# The Subtle Art of Surrender: a morning practice of release

*and what we can learn from turtles, geese, and gravity*

Do you ever notice how once you’ve paid attention to something, you suddenly see it everywhere?[^1] Last week this showed up as “**turtles all the way down**” — a saying I’d no recollection of ever hearing before. And then, of course, it popped up in multiple conversations, always initiated by others. I’m mentioning it here, because it speaks to an infinity of recursion and question loops. If this, then that—but then, what’s that? Oh, that’s made up of this. And this? That. And so on.

This (and that) absolutely seduces my brain in hibernation mode: reflecting and then reflecting on my reflection, and so forth. No wonder I struggle with slowing down!

You do not have to walk on your knees  
For a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.  
You only have to let the soft animal of your body  
love what it loves.

—Mary Oliver, from "Wild Geese"

Oh Mary, you always know what to say!

This begs me to come back to myself. I needn’t dig down to the center of the earth to know indisputably what's holding up the ground as I walk. OK, maybe it'd be fun to do once, but once it's compulsive, it's prohibitive.

The soft animal of my body loves feeling held. It/I don’t[^2] need to know what’s holding that which is holding me. I can feel the expansive sureness, a solid embrace I want to relax inside of. Here, I can remain curious without exhausting myself needing to know anything other than the sensation of being held and belonging.

**This is what I feel for every morning as I transition from dream life to waking life,** before opening my eyes and leaving the warmth of my blanketed cocoon and the puppy pressed against my hips. I **feel for gravity** and allow myself to sink into it, to **surrender my bones and entire body and breath** to it. It almost drowns out any snoring that would otherwise be driving me mad. And for moments, this simple surrender quiets my mind that’s already seduced by everything wanting my attention.

### **Practice**

When you wake up, before you get out of bed, take a few moments to:

> *   Breathe on purpose and pay attention to your breath. I like to play with a resonance breath _(roughly in for 5, out for 5)_ and a box breath _(e.g. in for 4, hold for 4, out for 4, hold for 4)_, but any intentional breathing will suffice.
>     
> *   Feel for gravity and notice what it feels like as you surrender to it. Notice where you may be holding tension and then explore with releasing.
>     
>     *   For me, it’s _always_ in my face and the more I do this, the more I notice subtle holds in my eyebrows, at the corners of my lips, the center of my chin and forehead. Every day and practice is different.
>         
> *   It’s ok if you already have other thoughts creeping in—just keep bringing your attention back to gravity and where you can release just a little bit.
>     

### **Reflection**

> Where do you notice resistance and tension as you practice surrendering to gravity? What’s that telling you about what you care about?

P.S. The writing of this post became its own example of a turtles digression and geese escape. Sometimes, it seems, the meandering is the message ;)

[^1]: This “frequency illusion” is known as the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon, explained in cognitive science as selective attention and confirmation bias, though I like to over-simplify it with the poetic: **where attention goes, energy flows**. It’s at the root of “what we measure, we improve” and the equally potent “what we think we see (or don’t), we obsess over” in seasons of scarcity, like winter.

[^2]: Oh English, you continue to surprise me. Here I thought you lacked finesse in your ability to describe the human condition. And yet, you decided to honor “I” as a composite—pairing it with plural verbs. My (party) busload of parts thanks you.
