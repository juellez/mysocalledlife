As folx reach out with topics they’d love me to cover, I’m reminded of a common struggle: seeing and acknowledging the work that goes in behind-the-scenes of the success that we see. This is a reminder that behind every great vision and “success” is a series of daily actions that require commitment. And when those daily actions light you up? That’s when you’ve set sail and can enjoy being with the winds blowing you towards where you want to go. The best part is that we can enjoy our journey -and- our destination. Like all things life teaches us: the magic lies not in binary thinking, but in paradox.

> **PRACTICE:** Envision a goal or dream that you’ve been working towards. Imagine this is the gravity you feel holding you. What are the day-to-day experiences that will move me toward my vision? And how can I fall in love with them?

A reading showcasing art from the [Spacious Tarot](https://thespacioustarot.com/) and Kim Krans’ [The Wild Unknown](https://kimkrans.com/the-wild-unknown) Pocket Animal Spirit Deck.

In my morning ritual, I posed two questions and drew some cards. Here’s a snippet of what resonated for me. May you use what’s helpful and toss the rest.

> My Journey: What space can I bring into or tap into within my every day that will keep me moving towards my destination while allowing me to enjoy the journey?

FIVE OF CUPS — It’s tempting to only see what’s broken or to ignore it and swim for the other two. If I rush, I risk cutting my feet, being swept away in the current. I can also remember that **with every struggle there is a joy. And with every joy there is a struggle**. Allow myself the time to grieve, to allow the sadness the flow into the river. And within that, allow myself to be held within the knowing that the sadness is not all there is. Even emotions are not binary. We are capable of holding a vast range of emotions, simultaneously. 

> My Destination: What’s possible as I stay present to my journey?

THE WORLD: This is the last card of the Fool’s/Hero’s Journey through the major arcana. Earth within the constellations reminds us that we are simultaneously an entire world and a speck within the universe. “Be at home _within_ yourself and remember that you _belong_ in this universe.” The spiral reminds us that we are unending and never beginning; as one phase concludes, expansion continues. This card speaks to the process Jung called individuation: integrating all aspects of your psyche in order to connect with your Self. “The Self is the seat of your soul, the unification of ego, personal consciousness, and collective consciousness. Know that you are complete. You are magic in motion.”

“Be at home _within_ yourself and remember that you _belong_ in this universe… Know that you are complete. You are magic in motion.” — [Spacious Tarot](https://thespacioustarot.com/) by Carrie Mallon and Annie Ruygt

> My Guides: What energy can I tap into to align my journey and destination?

MOUSE — Detail-oriented, nit-picky, nervous. It’s easy to get lost in the details, to get busy with no purpose. Mouse is a reminder to balance such energetic tendencies by bringing in a meaningful project, grounding into our purpose as we take action. When in balance:

HORSE: Momentum, freedom, expansive, force—fully awakened & alive. Horse represents the most masterful of Earth energy, providing us with momentum so reliable and supportive that we can ride on its back toward any goal, no matter how difficult the terrain. This becomes available to us when we **hone and collect our energy through daily practice**, a reminder that the daily practice within our journey carries us to our destination, itself a part of a longer journey.

Physical stamina (exercise) and mental focus (meditation) are the secret weapons behind the Horse’s legacy. When in balance: achieves anything, never gives up. When out of balance: runs away, feels weak. To bring into balance: Strength training. — Kim Krans in [The Wild Unknown Animal Spirit Deck](https://kimkrans.com/the-wild-unknown)
