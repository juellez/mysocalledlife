# Self Nourishment [6 min grounding meditation]

*Feeling anxious, disconnected, or depleted? Treat yourself to a nourishing 6 minutes with this guided meditation.*

We're revisiting our very first post: a Guided Grounding for Self Nourishment. Why? Because self-care can often feel like *work*, and this is a practice in *receiving*—exactly as we are. There’s no suggestion that we ought to be feeling any other way than we are, simply space for us to be and *receive*. (Who couldn’t use more of that?)

And, like drinking water, eating nutritious food, and practicing good hygiene, self-nourishment is essential maintenance for a healthy nervous system.

So, whether you're new to Soundbites or have been here from the start, I invite you to this practice of allowing yourself to deeply receive—to feel connected, loved, and nourished. Use it as inspiration, and perhaps craft your own. 

How are you weaving self-nourishment into your daily self-care routine?
