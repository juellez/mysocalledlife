# An Equinox Invitation for Grounding in Balance through Transition

*Taking a cue from Mother Nature to check our balance as we move through transitions.*

Today's seasonal transition marks a time when our days and nights are balanced. The calendar tells us it’s officially autumn (up here in the Northern Hemisphere), but when will/did it start to feel like autumn? When will/did it stop feeling like summer?

My hunch is that your answers are more experiential and sense-based than date-driven. Perhaps you thought of sights, scents, events, tastes, or traditions as cues. For me, autumn is marked by changing leaves, Friday night lights and echos, the quieting of the evening choir, early evening walks that are both cool and warm, and harvest dinners and holidays. It’s when I pull out my blankets and layers but am not quite ready to stash my shorts and short-sleeves.

In this reflection, I’m reminded that transitions rarely have a fixed start or end. I can easily forget that I’m inside of a transition, or feel like I’m forever stuck inside of one even when the world reflects to me that I’m “done”. Even a universal one like the transition from “not-alive” to “alive” has been garnering debate longer than we can keep history.

The intention behind this reflection and these questions isn’t to come up with some indisputable start or end to our transitions. It’s to sit within the experience of being in transition that has no indisputable bookends and to explore what balance feels like—knowing that what we need to sense balance is also always shifting and never fixed.

> **PRACTICE 1:** The next time you’re walking—around the house, office, or outside on an intentional stroll, I invite you to notice what it feels like to be in balance while in motion. You can do this while riding a bike, paddling a boat, and even sitting. How is this similar to and different from the balance you feel when you’re standing still? What are the ways you perceive balance in your body?

> **PRACTICE 2:** Think of a transition that you’re in. It could be a project, a work or career goal, a relationship, a habit you’re trying to start or quit, a mindset—anything. The next 5 times you walk through a doorway, take a moment to pause (even if only in your mind) to notice yourself inside of the transition, leaving one space (old state) and entering a new one. Are you grounded? (Feel for your feet if you’re walking / your seat if you’re sitting.) As you enter the new room/space, imagine yourself entering the other side of your transition. What tells you (internally) that you’re on the other side?

> Whatever you notice (or don’t) is OK. But take that moment to notice—and then notice what (if anything) shifts as you repeat the practice.

How will feeling for balance and your internal cues as to when you’ve passed through this season support you in powerfully moving through your transition? As always, I’d love to hear from you. Stay brilliant and awesome.
