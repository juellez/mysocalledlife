# Do you ever feel like a failure despite meaningful momentum? [Guided Practice]

*A guided Centered Extension practice for when how you feel doesn't align up with external metrics and feedback&#8212;and that pesky "Just Around the Corner" syndrome.*

A common theme that surfaced this past week is around that pesky gap between how we’re _performing_ and how we’re _feeling_—and ye ol’ famous “Just Around the Corner” syndrome \[@ 2:40\]. On one hand, knowing that our feelings don’t match the circumstances can help us gain perspective, but then what?

##### PRACTICE \[@ 4:20\]

> “Centered Extension” for the sake of _generating_ the experience we want to be having, as soon as _x_ happens or I get _y_, _right_ _now_.

##### REFLECT

> When you’re able to bring the experience of success that you _wish you were having_ into the actions you’re _already taking,_ what changes? Anything in relation to your ability to or timeline around achieving your goals? What surprised you in trying out this practice?

Wanna practice with me live? Join me in a [Community Somatic Drop-in](https://kaleidoscopes.group/community-calls) (it’s free)—where a fellow [Strozzi somatics](https://strozziinstitute.org/) certified coach and I lead embodiment practices like this twice a month.
