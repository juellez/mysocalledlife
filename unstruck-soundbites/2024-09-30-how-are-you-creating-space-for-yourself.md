# How are you creating space for yourself this week? [4.5m]

*The intersection of boredom, busyness, and being of service to yourself*

This morning’s invitation was inspired by an intersection of pondering busyness, utilizing boredom, and a desire to be of service—to others *and* Self. 

**Invitation**: What’s one small thing you can take on as a practice and commitment this week around creating space for yourself every day?

**Practice Idea**:  Can you notice when you grab for your phone to stay busy or distracted and instead take the moment *(in a line, on hold, on the toilet, etc.)* to allow yourself to be bored and check-in with your body and thoughts?

I’d love to hear what you come up with as your practice & what you learn inside of the it. What’s available for you when you have these micro-moments for yourself?

Cheers to an awesome week!
